# hsfwsc - Http Static File With Status Code

Some code I got out of net/http to serve static files with a specific error code.

Don't look into the code. It's just copy paste all over the place. Have a look at
net/http if you really want to take a look at how stuff is done.

## What? That name doesn't have vowels and is too hard to remember!

Who gives a shit. You'll probably have to import it once in your life anyway.
If you really feel like you need an easier to remember name, use named imports.
